## Project Summary

This project analyzes a dataset of ~426,000 used car listings from Craigslist to determine the key factors that drive resale price. Using the CRISP-DM framework, I built and compared multiple regression models, with **Ridge Polynomial achieving an R² of 0.7323** and MAE of ~$4,800.

### Key Findings (For the Dealership Owner)
- **Low mileage + newer trucks/SUVs = highest resale value**
- **Clean title** is non-negotiable — salvage titles lose 40–60% of value
- **Top brands**: Ford F-150, Ram 1500, Toyota Tacoma/4Runner, Porsche, Tesla
- **Avoid**: high-mileage sedans, minivans, salvage titles, economy brands

**Recommendation**: Focus inventory on 2015–2020 low-mileage 4WD trucks and SUVs with clean titles — these sell fastest and at the highest margins.
